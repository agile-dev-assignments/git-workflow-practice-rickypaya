[Evelyn Miralles, an influential Latinx software engineer at NASA](https://hispanicexecutive.com/evelyn-miralles-university-of-houston-clear-lake/)

I chose this article because it is an impactful article detailing the accomplishments and successes of an influential Latinx software engineer at NASA, Evelyn Marialles. It at first stuck out to me as being a first generation Latinx student who also studies computer sciecne, it is always motivating to see a forgeign born engineer making their way to being the only woman engineer working on NASA's first VR-ready flight software for human spaceflight training. This team worked on the beginning stages of development for a new graphical system that would support the International Space Station and Space Shuttle training. Miralles continued on to co-author the Dynamic Onboard Ubiquitous Graphics (DOUG) flight software, which has been used since 2000 to train astronauts using Virtual reality technology. Her achievements continue with being apart of the STS 61 mission which repaired the Hubble Space Telescope in 1993, and all Space Shuttle and ISS missions afterwards.
